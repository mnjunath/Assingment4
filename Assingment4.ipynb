Instead, the references to the nested objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries) are shared between the original and the copy.\n","   - In other words, a shallow copy copies the **top-level** container, but not the objects contained inside it. The nested objects remain **shared** between the original and the copy.\n","\n","   **Example:**\n","   ```python\n","   import copy\n","\n","   original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n","   shallow_copy = copy.copy(original)\n","\n","   \n","   shallow_copy[0][0] = 99\n","\n","   print(\"Original:\", original)  \n","   print(\"Shallow Copy:\", shallow_copy)  \n","   ```\n","\n","   - In this example, changing an element in the **nested list** in `shallow_copy` also affects the `original` list because the inner lists are shared between them.\n","\n","### 2. **`copy.deepcopy()` (Deep Copy)**:\n","   - **Purpose**: Creates a **deep copy** of the original object.\n","   - **Behavior**: A deep copy creates a **new object** and recursively copies all the objects inside it, including nested objects. It means that the original object and the copy are completely independent, and modifying the nested objects in one will not affect the other.\n","   - A deep copy copies not only the **top-level container** but also **all nested objects**, creating a fully independent copy.\n","\n","   **Example:**\n","   ```python\n","   import copy\n","\n","   original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n","   deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original)\n","\n","   \n","   deep_copy[0][0] = 99\n","\n","   print(\"Original:\", original)  \n","   print(\"Deep Copy:\", deep_copy)  \n","   ```\n","\n","   - In this case, the change in the **nested list** inside `deep_copy` does **not** affect `original`, because the entire structure has been copied, including all nested objects.\n","\n","### Summary of Differences:\n","\n","| **Aspect**              | **`copy.copy()` (Shallow Copy)**                               | **`copy.deepcopy()` (Deep Copy)**                         |\n","|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n","| **Copy Type**           | Shallow copy (copies the top-level object, nested objects are referenced) | Deep copy (recursively copies all nested objects)         |\n","| **Nested Objects**      | Nested objects are **shared** between original and copy       | Nested objects are **independent** between original and copy |\n","| **Performance**         | Faster (as it only copies the top-level container)            | Slower (due to recursive copying of all objects)          |\n","| **Use Case**            | Suitable for simple, non-nested objects or when changes to nested objects should reflect in both copies | Suitable for independent copies, especially for complex, nested structures |\n","\n","### When to Use:\n","- **Use `copy.copy()` (shallow copy)** if you only need a copy of the **top-level container**, and you're okay with sharing the references to nested objects.\n","- **Use `copy.deepcopy()` (deep copy)** if you need a completely independent copy of an object, including all nested objects, so changes in one copy won't affect the other.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Xjsrm8YhLRvQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"yLHAPNh-LyNJ"}}]}
